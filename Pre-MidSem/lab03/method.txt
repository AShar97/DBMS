On unarchiving the file named "database-19-jan-2018.tgz", a directory named "database-19-jan-2018" is generated which has a subdirectory also named "database-19-jan-2018". Place the submission code c source file outside the outer directory such that its sister directory is named "database-19-jan-2018", which in-turn also has a subdirectory named "database-19-jan-2018" containing all the data.
